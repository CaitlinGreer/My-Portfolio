   <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
    <p>After working as a hairstylist for most of my life I felt it was time for a change.  So I chose to hang up the shears and pick up the keyboard.  I've always had an interest in writing code and programming and there's no time like the present for a new career adventure.</p>
     
    <p>Choosing to go back to school at 
      <a href="https://bloc.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Bloc</a> 
      has been one of the most rewarding challenges I've ever taken on.  I'm looking forward to learning so much more and pushing myself to learn and be the best developer I can be.
    </p>
    <p>I truly believe learning from people with more experience than you is the best way to learn, so let's build some things!  Reach out and let's work on some projects together!
