   <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
 <!--add a few paragraphs about how you got here -->
    <p>After a life long career of working as a hairstylist, it was time for me to find a new way to create.  So I chose to hang up the shears and pick up the mouse and keyboard.  I've always had an interest in writing code and programming so there's no time like the present for a new career adventure.</p>
    <p>Choosing to go back to school at

      <a href="https://bloc.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Bloc</a> 
      has been one of the most rewarding challenges I've ever taken on.  I'm looking forward to learning so much more and pushing myself to learn and be the best developer I can be.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not sitting at the computer, you can find me bouncing around Disney World soaking up some Disney magic or spending some quality time with my 2 dogs.</p>
    <p>I truly believe learning from people with more experience than you is the best way to learn, so let's build some things!  Reach out and let's work on some projects together!
