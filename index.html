   <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    <p>Here's some information you may not know about me.  Sentences and paragraphs with info all about me.
        Maybe some day I'll be better at writing things about myself but until then, I'll just continue 
        to write some shit.
     
    <p>Let's get crazy and write another full paragraph about how I got here and stuff.  I'm in school now so that's
        fun right?
    </p>
    <p>Learning from experience is the best way to learn, so let's learn together.  Reach out and let's work on 
        some things together!
